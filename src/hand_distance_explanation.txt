This Python script uses the cvzone and mediapipe libraries to detect and track hand gestures in a live video stream. 
The script calculates the distance between the user's hands and the camera, as well as the distance between the user's two hands.

First, the necessary libraries are imported, and the webcam is set up for video capture. 
The HandDetector object is created to detect hands in the video stream. 
The object is set to detect with a confidence threshold of 0.8, and to track a maximum of two hands.

Next, there is an array of x and y values that represent the raw data and corresponding centimeter values. 
The numpy.polyfit function is used to fit a second-order polynomial to this data, which will be used to calculate the distance between the hands and the camera.

Several helper functions are defined to calculate distances and set a bounding box for each hand in the video stream. 
The calc_diagonal function calculates the diagonal distance between two points. The calc_distance_cam function calculates the distance between the camera and a hand, using the polynomial fit coefficients. 
The calc_distance_hands function calculates the distance between the user's two hands. Finally, the set_bound_box function draws a bounding box around a hand and displays the calculated distance.

The script then enters a loop to capture and process video frames. 
The detector.findHands function is called to detect hands in the video stream. If a hand is detected, the script extracts several hand landmarks and information about the hand, such as its type and bounding box coordinates. 
The calc_distance_cam function is called to calculate the distance between the camera and the hand, and the set_bound_box function is called to display the bounding box and the calculated distance.

If two hands are detected, the calc_distance_hands function is called to calculate the distance between the hands, and the cvzone.putTextRect function is used to display this distance on the video stream. 
Finally, the processed video frame is displayed in a window, and the script waits for a key press to exit.
